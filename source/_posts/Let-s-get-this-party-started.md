So, I am giving this whole blog idea another try. I've always really liked writing
but I often found that I had to little time to be wasting it writing. I would go
off and study my chords or javascript. But reading and building and playing isn't
like talking. Sometimes the talking about it reveals new incites. This is
especially true with coding.

In programming, and specifically web development, there is more out there than
one person could ever learn, and new technologies are being created every day.
When taking on the mantle of developer one must commit to continual learning,
so as not to get left behind with the technology.

Anyway, I discovered [hexo](https://hexo.io/), the framework this blog is built on, and
decided to experiment with it. I'm jazzed up to start writing again.

I want this to be an everything sort of blog, so that I am more likely to
contribute. As previously stated, I'm prone to get bored of it, or back out When
it starts to seem like a chore. Then I caulk it up to my need to spend time in more
important areas. Either way, I'm still going, and here I am back again to write.

I'll be talking about coding, and development, and javascript a lot here. I'm
about to join an online group called a cohort. I'll probably blog about that some.
Of course, there is Dexter and my thoughts on parenting. My love for consumables
or even a game review might make it in here. And of course, anyone that knows me
knows that I will always be promoting something musical.
